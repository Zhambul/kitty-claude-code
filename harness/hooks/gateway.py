"""Record pushed hook deliveries — the daemon-side half of the hook channel.

The one recorder of hook raw events: a delivery arrives over HTTP, the harness's
`HarnessHookGateway` turns it into raw events, and they are appended here. It
records only — translation stays with the interpreter's next tick.

It also RESOLVES the one observation a client cannot interpret for itself: the
hook process reports its own pid, and the CLI's pid is an ancestor of it, which
takes the harness's process name to recognise. That name is on the plugin
descriptor, here, in the daemon.
