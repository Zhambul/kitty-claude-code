#
# A hook delivery's BODY is the exact stdin bytes the harness wrote, so
# everything the hook process observed around itself has to ride beside them.
# These headers are that channel, and they have exactly two readers each: a hook
# client in `client/` stamps them, the hook-delivery endpoint reads them
# (api/hooks/routes.py). The client's copy of these names lives in
# client/_http.py and is pinned to this file by tests/test_canonical_clients.py —
# a client may not import the application.
#
# They live here rather than in core/daemon/contract.py because they are HARNESS
# vocabulary — an account, a CLI process, a launch selection — not general
# daemon plumbing. The generic half (host, port, the control-plane guard
# header, the ordinary body caps) stays in core/daemon/contract.py.
# Import-pure: literals only.

# — and the ancestry walk it takes to name the CLI needs the harness's process
# name, which is plugin vocabulary the client must not import. The chain is
# provably alive while the daemon walks it: the CLI is blocked on this very
# delivery's response.

# A hook delivery carries the harness's exact hook stdin — a post-tool payload
