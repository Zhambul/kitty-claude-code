"""Provide the commands module."""
# harness/impl/codex/commands.py — slash-command vocabulary for a CODEX session's
# "/" menu (the codex twin of harness/impl/claude_code/slashcmds.py).
#
# The web composer offers the same "/" autocomplete the codex TUI does, but a
# codex session's commands are NOT Claude's: it has /plan, /approvals, /review,
# … and NOT /goal, /rewind, /agents. The old fan-out concatenated every
# plugin's list, which was only ever right because claude_code was the sole
# provider — so a codex session was offered Claude's vocabulary (the reported
# "/plan isn't recognized" gap). Now plugins.slash_commands is host-SCOPED (the
# session's OWNING host answers), and this is codex's answer.
#
# Same contract as slashcmds.py: the TUI stays AUTHORITATIVE — the composer only
# TYPES the command and codex's own palette executes it — so this list only has
# to be good enough to complete against, never to validate. BUILTINS is a
# curated snapshot (drift is harmless: an unknown or dropped name still types
# fine), and custom entries are discovered from codex's prompts directory
# ($CODEX_HOME/prompts/*.md — codex's user-defined `/name` prompts), the codex
# analog of Claude's .claude/commands walk.
