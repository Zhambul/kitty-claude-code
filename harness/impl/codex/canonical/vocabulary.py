# harness/impl/codex/canonical/vocabulary.py — codex's SYNTHETIC vocabulary.
#
# Telling codex MACHINERY from a real conversation turn — STRUCTURAL, not an
# ever-growing allowlist (the ONE owner of codex's synthetic vocabulary,
# styleguide table; a presenter must not re-encode it). Two structural facts +
# one tiny supplement:
#
#   1. ROLE. A `response_item/message` with role developer/system is the SYSTEM
#      CHANNEL — never a conversation turn (the context codex re-injects, the
#      multi-agent/permissions/skills scaffolding). Caught by role alone, so a new
#      developer-role block needs no list entry.
#   2. `<tag>` WRAPPER. Every codex role=user system injection is a
#      `<lower_or spaced tag>…` block (<recommended_plugins>, <environment_context>,
#      <turn_aborted>, …); a real prompt is free prose. So a role=user `<tag>` block
#      is synthetic BY DEFAULT — robust to new tags — EXCEPT an INPUT wrapper.
#
# Both rollout registers read this module: the event_msg one (events.py) to
# unwrap a `<task>` prompt, the response_item one (items.py) for the whole test.
import re

from harness.impl.codex.canonical.records import EmptyRecord

# INPUT_WRAPPERS: a role=user `<tag>` that IS a real turn, not scaffolding —
# codex delivers a subagent's task as `<task>…</task>`. Kept AND unwrapped to its
# inner text (strip_input_wrapper) so the bubble reads as the prompt, not markup.
INPUT_WRAPPERS = ("task",)

# The ASSISTANT wrapper that is a PLAN. codex's plan mode has no tool call and
# no event of its own: the proposal arrives as an ordinary role=assistant
# response_item whose text is wrapped in `<proposed_plan>…</proposed_plan>`, and
# it is the ONLY register it appears in (that turn writes no `agent_message`).
# So the structural synthetic rule — "a wrapper tag we don't know is codex
# machinery" — swallowed it, and a codex plan session showed the plan NOWHERE on
# the web while every other bubble in the thread rendered (the reported bug).

# that is neither role-marked nor `<tag>`-wrapped). The `<…>` entries the old list
