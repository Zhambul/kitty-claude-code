# harness/impl/claude_code/controls/tui.py — how text reaches Claude Code's `>` input box.
#
# The ONE delivery channel every gesture that puts a `/…` SLASH COMMAND in front
# of Claude Code goes through (the compact / model / effort quick commands, a
# live `/rename <name>`, the argless auto-rename, `/rewind` — including the one
# rewindmenu.drive types itself). It lives with the host that owns the box: it
# encodes two facts about Claude Code's TUI and nothing else's, and a plugin may
# not import the dashboard, where it used to sit (dashboard/control/launch.
# type_command, moved here byte-identically when the gestures did).

    """Return the type command.

    Put a SLASH COMMAND into a session's input box and submit it. Returns
        (ok, cleared_clipboard_image).

        THE one way to do that — raw keystrokes are NOT SAFE in that box. With
        `editorMode: vim` the input is MODAL, and anything that pressed Escape first
        (the interrupt presses up to `INTERRUPT_TRIES`) leaves it in NORMAL mode,
        where the characters are vim COMMANDS rather than text: `/` opens reverse
        history search, and Claude Code's own hint spells out the workaround —
        *"press Esc then i then / to open the command menu instead"*. Measured
        2026-07-25: a web rewind ~14s after a web interrupt typed `/rewind` into a
        NORMAL-mode box, the checkpoint menu never opened, and the tail of the
        keystrokes was submitted into the conversation as the message `nd` (the
        first `web-rewind-to` `step: "open"` failure in the audit; the identical `nd`
        artifact recorded earlier in the Esc-gesture comment was blamed on a racing
        Escape, which now looks like the wrong diagnosis).

        A BRACKETED PASTE is mode-proof — Claude Code takes it as content, never as
        keystrokes — and it is already how the quick commands (`/compact`,
        `/model`, `/effort`) reach the TUI, which is why those kept working where
        the typed `/rewind` did not. The Enter rides outside the paste
        (the terminal's own submit convention), so it still submits.

        The clipboard-image guard comes with it: a bracketed paste can make Claude
        Code attach an unrelated image from the board. No caller can paste before
        this one delivery owner clears that accidental input.

        DELIVERY IS VERIFIED, not assumed. Even with the CR as its own delayed
        keystroke, the submit is swallowed intermittently (measured 2026-08-15,
        session 4597c616: a ~50-char web send pasted fine and sat UNSUBMITTED in the
        box while the control audited `acknowledged`). So after the paste the box
        itself is read back: if the message is still sitting there, Enter is
        re-sent with backoff, and a message that never leaves the draft is a FAILED
        delivery — the caller reports indeterminate instead of lying. Multi-line
        pastes collapse into Claude Code's placeholder. Attachment delivery uses
        `ensure_submit`, which sends the bounded Enter retry budget for that case.

    Returns:
        Type command.
