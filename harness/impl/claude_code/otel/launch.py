"""Start Claude Code's plugin-owned OTLP receiver when telemetry is enabled.

Runs INSIDE the daemon (a `SessionStarted` reactor), so this is a spawner and
not a client: the receiver itself is `client/claude_otel.py`, and everything it
needs is passed on its argv — the daemon's address, the port to bind and how
long to sit idle. Passing them is what keeps the pre-check below and the bind
over there reading the same numbers.
