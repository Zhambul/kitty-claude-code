# Claude Code OTEL receiver configuration — the numbers the daemon hands the
# client (stdlib-only, import-pure).
#
# The OTLP port MUST resolve identically in launch.py's already-listening
# pre-check and the receiver's bind: if the two drift, the launcher either probes
# a port nobody binds (a doomed duplicate spawn every SessionStart) or sees a
# stranger's listener and never spawns the receiver at all. Single-sited here,
# and now unambiguous — the receiver no longer resolves anything itself, it is
# TOLD (client/claude_otel.py takes both numbers on its argv).
