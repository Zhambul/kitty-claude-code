"""Which turn is open, per actor.

Claude Code announces no turn boundary of its own: its Stop hook says a turn
ENDED and nothing at all says one began, so every fact it reports used to carry
no turn. The user's PROMPT is the boundary — a turn is the answer to something
somebody asked — so a prompt opens one and everything until the Stop rides it.

Kept per actor because a subagent's turns are its own, and per session because
one translator serves every session in the process.

Two deliberate limits. An ordinary prompt that arrives while a turn is open
does not open a second one: an injection is part of that turn. A queued prompt
with `promptSource=queued` is different. Claude can write it before the native
interrupt marker, although it starts the work after the interrupt. That prompt
replaces the open turn, and the later marker still belongs to the replaced turn.
