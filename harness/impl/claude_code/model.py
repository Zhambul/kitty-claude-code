# harness/impl/claude_code/model.py — model / effort / context-window resolution
# for agents (historical name: claude_model.py — that compat shim is deleted).
#
# Extracted from claude-substream.py, where ~250 lines of config-dir walking,
# frontmatter parsing, and window tables had accreted (CLAUDE.md had always
# described this responsibility as shared-module territory). Everything here is
# a PURE function of its arguments plus the environment — no per-agent globals —
# so the substream (and anything else that needs to answer "what model/effort/
# window is this agent actually running?") composes these.
#
# Background, in one place:
# - There is NO context-size frontmatter field (docs): the window follows the
#   resolved MODEL, which an agent can pin explicitly (e.g. `model: opus[1m]`).
#   Sonnet 5 / Fable 5 / Opus 4.6-4.8 run 1M by default (no suffix), older
#   models are 200k unless [1m], and CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT caps all.
# - Effort is NOT recorded in any transcript — it's config-only, resolved
#   env > agent-def frontmatter `effort` > session `effortLevel` > the model's
#   own default (docs: high on Opus 4.8/4.6 / Sonnet 5 / Sonnet 4.6 / Fable 5,
#   xhigh on Opus 4.7). A session-only `/effort` isn't persisted, so it can't
#   be seen here.
