"""The engine's own synthetic raw events, as documents.

Raw-event payloads that nothing outside this tree ever produces: a chunk
of a followed output file, the observation that a CLI process is gone, and the
mark left by an interrupt no native raw event corroborated. They are OURS on
both ends — written by `engine/interpret/`, read by a translator — and each was
a dict literal at the writer and a field-by-field read at the reader, with
nothing but agreement between two files holding the shape together.

Declared here, beside the source-type constants that name them
(`harness/models/raw_events.py`), because both ends may import this and neither
may import the other. Encoded and decoded by `repository/mapper/documents.py`,
the one place in the tree that turns an object into bytes.
