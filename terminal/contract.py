"""The terminal implementation boundary — five narrow protocols, one plugin.

A terminal is a PLUGIN, the same shape as a harness plugin: a frozen dataclass
with one typed field per sub-protocol, resolved once at bootstrap and passed
down. Consumers take the field they need — the launcher takes `tabs`, a screen
driver takes `input` + `viewport` — so what a component can do to a terminal is
readable from its constructor.

Every write is best-effort and SILENT: a failure is a failure-shaped response,
never an exception. The caller audits what matters.

This file and `terminal/models/` know nothing about sessions, harnesses, or any
concrete terminal. They are keyed on window ids and nothing else, which is why
the harness contract may import them without inverting a layer.
