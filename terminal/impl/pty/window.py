"""One pseudo-terminal window: a process, its tty, and the screen it painted.

A window here is a pty this process owns rather than something a terminal
application shows, which is what makes this terminal headless. The program on
the other side cannot tell the difference: it has a tty, so it runs its full
TUI, negotiates its keyboard mode, and repaints exactly as it would anywhere.

The output is drained by a thread rather than on demand. A TUI that fills the
pty buffer with nobody reading BLOCKS, and a blocked program looks exactly like
a broken one. Every byte drained is fed to a terminal emulator, because the pty
gives paint operations — "move to row 3, erase to end, write these cells" — and
a screen is what those operations ADD UP TO. Scraping the escapes out of the
stream instead answers a different question: everything that was ever painted,
including what has since been overwritten.
