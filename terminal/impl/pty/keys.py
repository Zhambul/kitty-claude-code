r"""Key EVENTS as the bytes a terminal sends for them.

The translation a terminal application does inside itself, done here because a
pty has no one to do it: the program reads bytes, and a key name is not one. Only the keys the
product actually sends are here — a name with no encoding is refused rather than
guessed at, because a guess arrives as some other keystroke and reads exactly
like a program that ignored the gesture.

The escape sequences are the NORMAL (cursor-key) mode ones. A program that has
switched the keypad into application mode expects SS3 (`\\x1bOA`) instead, and
this does not track that mode — the honest limit of driving a pty from outside,
where the terminal that owns the screen knows because it is the emulator.
