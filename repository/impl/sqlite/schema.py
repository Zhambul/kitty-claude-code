"""Every table we own, in one file, with one version per database.

Two databases, and the reason each is its own file is in `core/data.py`.

The write split inside `main.db` is the design: `sessions` is written only by
the interpreter's session-upsert reaction (birth and upkeep derive from
committed facts), `raw_events` by any recorder, and the interpretation tables
only by the interpreter. Positions are not stored anywhere separate: a pulled
source resumes from the `source_position` of the last raw event carrying its
`source_identity`, so recorded progress can never drift from the raw events.

There is no key-value table. Nine preference entities that used to be JSON
blobs under nine keys have nine tables with real primary keys; the queue, the
dialog answers and the usage windows are rows rather than encoded lists. Six
opaque columns remain and each is deliberate: `canonical_events.payload` is the
canonical fact body, closed and versioned by `repository/mapper/facts.py`;
`raw_events.payload` restores to the verbatim bytes we observed, which is the
whole point of keeping it; `state_files.content` is a free-form audit blob written by a
facade whose contract is "record anything, never raise"; and the three read-model
payloads (`session_data`, `session_data_actors`, `session_entries`) are closed
typed documents of `domain/sessiondata.py` and `domain/entries.py`, validated on
the way in and out the same way — a column per field would be a hundred
columns, half of them null, and none of them queried.

# Version 4 rewrote the canonical vocabulary, so files older than that remain
# intentionally unsupported. Version 5 removed harness-native selection ids
# from ModelReference. Version 6 repairs Codex yielded commands recorded before
# their adapter emitted the distinct output-finished fact: adding that fact to
# the canonical log keeps both the current projection and every later rebuild
# honest. Version 7 gives each queued send its request identity, so an HTTP
# retry cannot add the same message twice. Version 8 keeps the complete goal
# state and reason in the session read model instead of one completed flag.
# Version 9 settles Codex shell results that an older ambiguous parallel-command
# correlation added after their turn had already ended.
# Version 10 gives the interpreter a durable, indexed input queue. Before this,
# every 0.25-second tick scanned all raw-event history to prove that nothing was
# waiting. The queue is written and cleared in the same transactions as the raw
# observation and its verdict, so it cannot drift from either fact.
# Version 11 records the lossless storage codec for raw observations. Old rows
# stay byte-for-byte in place as `identity`; new rows are compressed before
# it reaches SQLite and restored at the repository boundary.
# Version 12 keeps the latest session lifecycle on the session row. SQLite
# updates it in the same transaction as a canonical start or finish fact. This
# removes two correlated history reads from every interpreter tick.
# Version 13 stores the stable owner checkout observed when a session starts.
# A linked worktree can later be removed, but its project group must not change.
# Version 14 adds the durable, idempotent automatic-title job queue.
# Version 15 closes a yielded Codex shell whose native completion was recorded
# as a second shell after an application restart lost transient correlation.
# Version 16 repairs a resumed native run whose process exit deduplicated against
# an earlier run's session finish. Without the second finish, the interpreter
# keeps the dead session watchable and can replay a large rollout indefinitely.
# Version 17 makes the session activity index cover both values the session list
# aggregates. Without `occurred_at`, SQLite visited every entry table row, whose
# payload pages grow with the complete feed, to answer a three-column summary.
# Version 18 requeues ignored Claude PostToolUse hooks. TaskStop was previously
# nonsemantic, so affected background jobs have no output-finished fact. The
# current translator identifies TaskStop from the restored hook and recovers its
# shell relation from the native transcript. Other ignored hooks stay ignored.
# Version 21 runs the version 15 duplicate-shell repair again. Sessions created
# after version 15 could still hit that defect until restart correlation became
# durable in both translators.
# Version 22 accepts the observed native order: the replacement shell can finish
# before the empty wrapper marks the original shell as background work.
# Version 23 lets one shell follow several redirected output files.
# Version 24 gives stored tool counts named fields.
