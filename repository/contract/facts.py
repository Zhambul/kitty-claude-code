"""Raw events, verdicts and facts: the four tables the interpreter turns.

Three protocols, one per aggregate:

    RawEventRepository            append-only observations, and the backlog
    RawEventAuditRepository the forensic join across all four tables
    CanonicalEventRepository      the interpretations, and every canonical read

`record_translation` is the only multi-table write in the system and it is ONE
method: interpretation, facts and interpretation events in one transaction, decided inside the
repository. No caller ever holds a connection.
