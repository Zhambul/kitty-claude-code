"""The read model: the aggregate, the feed, and the one write that commits both.

Everything the frontends see lives in three tables, and this is the whole door
to them. The write side is a single method — one canonical event's effect on the
aggregate AND on the feed, committed together — because a reader that could
observe half an event would show a message whose actor does not exist yet.

The read side is five statements, all indexed: the snapshot, the entries page,
and the three deltas a stream polls. None of them touches the canonical log.
