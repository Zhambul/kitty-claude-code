"""What SQLite can actually be handed.

The mapper builds parameter tuples for `execute` / `executemany`, and those
were typed `SqlValues` — which says "anything at all" about the one
place where the set of acceptable values is fixed and small: sqlite3 binds
exactly these five and raises InterfaceError on everything else. A Decimal, a
SessionId that was never str()-ed, a dataclass someone forgot to unpack — all
of them type-checked, and all of them failed at the driver.
