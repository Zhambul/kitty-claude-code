# --- response-model fields reached only by serialization ------------------------
# Each of these is a frozen-dataclass field the browser reads, carried out by
# `dashboard.render.serialize.json_ready`'s `getattr(value, field.name)` fan-out.
# Vulture cannot follow that, and the three below stopped looking used only
# because the last non-serialization reader of the NAME went away with the code
# this refactor deleted. They belong here rather than in the shrink-only
# baseline: a serialized field is a framework contract, not debt.

completed  # api/sessiondata GoalResponse; read by HTTP model serialization

recorded  # RecordedResponse; serialized for telemetry clients.
request_options  # RateLimitsRequest; Pydantic serializes this field as params.

# `notify/presence.py`'s RouteDecision/RouteCandidate: read whole by
# `dataclasses.asdict(decision)` (notify/notifier.py, the `notify-route`
# audit row) rather than by field name, so vulture never sees the read.
age_s  # RouteCandidate
target_label  # RouteDecision
subscription_count  # RouteDecision

# anyio's capacity limiter: we ASSIGN the pool size the policy asked for and
# anyio reads it back when it hands out worker threads (api/app.py's lifespan).
# The only reference of ours is the assignment, which is what a framework
# attribute looks like from inside our own graph.
