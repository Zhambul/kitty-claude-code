"""Provide the entry module."""

# The feed, as both frontends receive it: one stored event and twenty-five bodies.
#
# All in one module, like the control outcomes: this is ONE closed vocabulary,
# and a reader deciding what to draw needs to see the whole of it at once. The
# discriminator is `type` on the STORED EVENT rather than inside each body, because
# an entry's kind is a fact about the entry, not a field of what it holds.
