# build_web_application() wires the routers, the error contract, the response
# middleware and the OpenAPI documents around one SINGLETON SCOPE: the registry
# every provider memoises into (app/injection.py). It builds no service itself —
# a node is built the first time something asks for it, by the framework — which
# is what lets the daemon and a test share one set of definitions and disagree
# only about the registry they hand in.
