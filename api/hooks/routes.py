    Recording happens on the request, never behind the interpreter tick — a

    exclusively here: a hook client in `client/` records nothing at all, so a
    delivery the daemon refused would otherwise vanish.

    The headers are read verbatim — every value is what the client OBSERVED, and
    the interpretation of it (the CLI pid behind a client pid, a valid account
    slug) happens below this, where the vocabulary lives.
