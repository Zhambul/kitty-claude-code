# Both used to be a bare `str`, so anything at all reached the store, the
# harness registry and — truncated to 200 characters, which is not the same as
# validated — the audit rows a stream writes about itself. Declaring the shape
# here turns that into the 400 the validation handler already renders, and puts
# the constraint in /openapi.yaml where a client can read it.
#
# NOT applied to `actor_id`, deliberately: an actor id is `<session>:lead` or
# whatever a translator read off a subagent, so it has no pattern to pin.
