# Service object to response model, for the shapes more than one plane sends.
#
# Same split as repository/mapper: the models are declarations with no methods,
# and the mapping is pure functions here. A model that knew how to build itself
# from a projection would be a model that imports the layer it exists to keep
# out of the api's vocabulary.
