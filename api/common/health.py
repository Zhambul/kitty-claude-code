#
# The daemon's singleton guard is the port bind, so "is it running, and which
# process is it" has to be answerable over the port itself: this is what the CLI
# reads for `status`, and whose pid it signals for `stop`. It touches no service
# — a wedged graph must not make the daemon unfindable. The boot identity is not
# here: the browser gets it on the SSE `ready` frame, which is where a client
# that must notice a restart already looks.
