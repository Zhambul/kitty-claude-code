"""The HTTP layer's own node: the policy this server runs under.

Each route dependency from the application is in an `app/provider_*.py` module.
This is the one thing that is not the application's — origin admission, the
read-only switch, the boot stamp — and it is declared here rather than there
because `app/` is the composition root and must not import the layer above it.

Same kernel, same scope: one Settings per application, on the application, so a
test overrides the switch instead of reaching for an import-time constant.
