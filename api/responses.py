# `response_model=` and the return annotation say what a route answers on its way
# out (the architecture suite requires one of the two). These say the rest, which
# /openapi.yaml previously claimed did not exist at all: the two statuses ANY
# request can end in, the four refusals the control-plane guard issues before a
# handler runs, and the outcome statuses the control and pane planes really
# return. A published document that describes only the happy path is not a
# contract, and this is the layer that knows the others.
