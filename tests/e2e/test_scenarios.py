"""Every live-harness scenario, bound to pytest.

One module for all features. It used to be one module per feature, several
files whose entire content was the same two lines with a different filename —
which is a directory pretending to be a structure. Selection is by name now:

    make test-drift E2E="-k greeting"
    make test-drift E2E="-k 'monitor or background'"

The markers are here because they are the same for every scenario and belong to
the SUITE rather than to any one of them: `drift` is what this suite is (it
catches a harness drifting under us), and the timeout is generous because a real
model answering a real prompt has nothing to do with the 30 s the hermetic suite
runs under.
