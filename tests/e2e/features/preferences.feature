Feature: browser-owned preferences round trip through the application

  Scenario Outline: new-session form state returns the last saved values
    When I save new-session choices for <harness> model <model> and low effort
    And I save new-session draft 'continue the E2E work'
    Then global new-session choices are <harness> model <model> and low effort
    And global new-session draft is 'continue the E2E work'

    Examples:
      | harness     | model        |
      | codex       | gpt-5.6-luna |
      | claude_code | haiku        |

  Scenario Outline: session display and composer state return the last saved values
    Given session configuration "primary" uses <harness> with model <model> and low effort
    When I launch session "primary" and assign work "prepare preferences" to the subagent with prompt
      """
      Reply with the exact marker PREFERENCES_PREPARED and no other text.
      """
    Then work "prepare preferences" completes
    And work "prepare preferences" has worker type subagent
    And work "prepare preferences" releases the lead
    When I assign work "open preferences" in session "primary" to the lead with prompt
      """
      <task_instruction>
      Reply only with the word ready.
      """
    Then work "open preferences" completes
    And work "open preferences" has worker type lead
    When I name the task in session "primary" with subject 'Saved task' "saved task"
    Then task "saved task" has state completed
    When I save composer draft 'unsent detail' for session "primary"
    And I set view mode focus for session "primary"
    And I mute notifications for session "primary"
    And I hide tasks for session "primary"
    Then composer draft for session "primary" is 'unsent detail'
    And view mode for session "primary" is focus
    And notifications for session "primary" are muted
    And tasks for session "primary" are hidden

    Examples:
      | harness     | model        | task_instruction                                                             |
      | codex       | gpt-5.6-luna | Use update_plan exactly once with one completed step named "Saved task".     |
      | claude_code | haiku        | Use TaskCreate once for "Saved task", then use TaskUpdate to mark it completed. |
