# dashboard/dictate.py — the Deepgram side of web dictation. The ONE owner of the dictation vocabulary: the key/keyterms
# file locations, the grant call, and the fully-assembled live-listen URL.
#
# The browser talks to Deepgram DIRECTLY over WebSocket — the stdlib dashboard
# server can't speak WS in either direction and must never see audio (it stays
# a read-only thing that mints tokens). So the server's whole job here is:
# read the long-lived API key from disk, trade it for a ~30s single-purpose
# grant JWT (POST /v1/auth/grant), and hand the page that JWT plus the listen
# URL with every server-decided parameter baked in (model, formatting,
# keyterms) — the client contributes only its AudioContext sample rate. The
# API key itself never leaves this process and never appears in a response,
# an audit row, or an error detail.
#
# Env knobs (read at CALL time, not import — the in-process test server flips
# them per-test): BAQYLAU_DICTATION_KEY_FILE / BAQYLAU_DICTATION_KEYTERMS_FILE
# override the file locations; BAQYLAU_DICTATION_GRANT_URL points the grant call
# at a fake server in tests (and is why grant() is testable hermetically).

# because native-rate PCM is 768 kbps of sustained uplink and an iPad over the
# tunnel could not hold that up — the send queue backed up and the native history
# fell further behind with every sentence.
# The range stays a sanity bound, not a config: the client is trusted to
# declare what it sends, but anything outside hardware reality is a bogus
# request. The rate is audited on every mint, so a regression to native-rate
# audio is visible in the `web-dictate` rows.
