"""baqylau-dashboard [serve|start|stop|status|open] [options].

The web dashboard's CLI lifecycle. The implementation behind the thin
bin/baqylau-dashboard entry (that filename is operational audit
vocabulary — the spawn below re-launches it by name). Lives in the package so
it is importable/testable in-process, like the rest of the dashboard tier.

  serve   — run the server in the foreground (what `start` spawns; also the
            debugging mode: crashes are visible instead of DEVNULL'd)
  start   — spawn the server detached (core/spawn.spawn_detached — audited,
            start_new_session) unless one is already running; prints the URL
  stop    — SIGTERM whoever answers on the port
  status  — the answering pid + URL
  open    — start (if needed) and open the browser        [the default]
  rebuild — re-derive the read model from the canonical log (see rebuild())

Three launch arguments, and they are the SAME three things every environment
that runs more than one daemon has to say: which port, which data directory,
where the output goes. They front the environment variables that have always
carried those answers rather than replacing them — a flag wins, the variable is
the default, and nothing that worked before stops working.

  --port N        the port to bind (or to ask, for stop/status)
  --data-dir DIR  the whole data directory: main.db, audit.db, uploads
  --log FILE      send this daemon's own output there (serve, and start's child)
  --harness-executable HARNESS=FILE
  --harness-config-dir HARNESS=DIR
  --harness-settings-file HARNESS=FILE

Every command takes the first two, not just the launching ones: `stop` and
`status` find the daemon BY ITS PORT, so a second daemon on a second port is
addressable the same way it was started. `start` forwards whatever it was given
to the `serve` it spawns, so the child's command line reads like the one a person
would have typed.

Import-pure: no argv/I/O/DB/frontend work at import — everything runs inside a
function (docs/architecture.md import-time purity rule).
