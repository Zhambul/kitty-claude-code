# Off-device alerts, layered on the same red/green transitions the in-page toast

# is open, since reaching you when away is the point.

# It used to be 60: wait a minute, and if the tab is still red assume you didn't
# react. Presence answers that question directly (are you at this device, is
# this session in front of you), so the clock's only remaining job is as an
# optional debounce for anyone who wants their alerts to hold fire. A bad /
# negative value falls back to the default.

# BAQYLAU_DASHBOARD_NOTIFICATION_SETTLE_SECONDS → the extra wait a `done` alert serves before it
# fires, DEFAULT 20. The one place the two kinds need different clocks, because
# their tab states mean different things: red ASKING is a blocked session that
# will sit there until you act, so a delay only makes you later; green DONE is
# the resting state of a finished TURN, which the very next turn leaves.
#
# Measured 2026-07-29 over a day of real alerts: of 46 delivered `done` pushes
# that were later retracted `tab-moved`, the MEDIAN lifetime was 14.3 s — the
# turn had ended, the push went out the same second, and by the time a macOS
# banner had settled on screen the session was busy again and the banner was
# correctly deleted. A notification that exists for 14 s is one you never see,
# and 30 of those 46 lived under 20 s. So the fix is not to stop retracting (the
# retraction is right — the alert had genuinely stopped being true) but to stop
# SENDING an alert about a green that hasn't held still yet.
#
# 20 s is the knee of that curve, not a round number: 10 s would have suppressed
# 8/46, 15 s → 25, 20 s → 30, and past it the curve flattens hard (25 s and 30 s
# → 31, 60 s → 32). Everything beyond 20 s buys a couple of points for seconds
# of added latency on the alerts that ARE real. Set 0 for the old fire-instantly
# behaviour. Bad / negative → the default.

# browser is shut. Telegram then ESCALATES a push: it fires as a nudge only if,
# ESCALATION_DELAY_SECONDS after that on-device push, you STILL haven't acted on the session
# (a reaction / a look drops the arm in the cancel loop first). There is no
# escalation after a stage-1 Telegram — it already reaches every device you own.
# Telegram is ALSO the fallback when there's nothing to push to (nobody
# subscribed).

# composing a reply — the alert is taken back: the Telegram message is deleted,
# and a resolve push closes the on-device banner. Note this is a NARROWER
# question than the one that cancels a PENDING alert: a mere glance suppresses
# an alert not yet sent ("you don't need to be told"), but must NOT delete one
# already delivered — looking at a red tab and walking away would then destroy
# your only reminder while the tab is still red. notifier._resolve enforces
# that distinction by comparing the delivered state with the current state.
