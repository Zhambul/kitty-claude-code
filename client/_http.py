# Every address, path, header name and environment-variable name the programs in

# a client that imported the daemon's constants would import the daemon, and the
# one property this directory has is that nothing in it knows the application
# exists. The copy is pinned —
# tests/test_canonical_clients.py::test_the_http_module_matches_the_daemon fails
# the moment any value here drifts from the module that reads it.

# Import-pure: one env read and literals.
