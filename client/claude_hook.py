"""Ship one Claude Code hook delivery to the daemon and print the reply.

~/.claude/settings.json names THIS FILE, once per hook event, and a harness
captures that path at session start and caches it for the process lifetime — so
the name is a published API. Add a new path first, repoint the config, and
remove the old file only once those sessions have ended.

It reads its stdin, stamps the flat values only this process can observe, POSTs
the exact bytes and writes back whatever comes. It parses nothing, decides
nothing and records nothing: `harness/impl/claude_code/hooks/gateway.py` says
what the delivery meant. A daemon that does not answer means this hook did
nothing, which is why every failure here is silence and exit 0 — a hook must
never fail its harness.
