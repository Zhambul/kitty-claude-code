# baqylau

**A kitty-terminal cockpit for Claude Code — built entirely out of hooks.**

*baqylau* (Kazakh *бақылау*) means observation — watching over every session.
Formerly known as *claude-kitty*.

Tab colors that track what Claude is doing, a live mirror pane streaming every
command and agent, an always-on SQLite audit trail, and a live web dashboard.
The hook pipeline is Python; the dashboard is a compiled Svelte application.

## Features

- **🎨 Tab colors** — the kitty tab reflects the session state at a glance,
  even from another tab: grey idle · magenta busy · blue running/awaiting ·
  red asking-*you* · green your-turn. Handles the hard part: Claude Code fires
  *no hook* on cancel/interrupt, so every cancellation path has its own
  recovery signal.
- **🪞 Command mirror pane** — a right-side split showing everything Claude
  does as colored streaming blocks: foreground/background commands (live
  output, syntax-highlighted), monitors, subagents and teammates (full
  transcript: prompt, messages, tools, result), and every codex run. Command
  blocks carry clickable ⧉ copy links; file-op one-liners click-to-expand
  their content in place (highlighted code, line-numbered diffs). A 5-row
  scoreboard underneath tracks messages, activity, tokens, and cost.
- **🔍 Audit trail** — every hook event, tab transition, stream lifecycle, and
  swallowed exception recorded to SQLite, so any bug is debuggable after the
  fact — with a live **⚠ warning light** on the scoreboard (and `⚠ audit:`
  one-liners in the mirror) whenever the session swallows an exception.

## Requirements

- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) with remote control enabled
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
- Python 3.12 and a project virtual environment at `.venv`
- Node.js 22.22.3 and npm 10.9.8 for dashboard builds and tests
- Optional: codex CLI ≥ 0.142 for the standalone codex host

## Installation

1. Clone the repo, create its virtual environment, and install its runtime and
   development dependencies:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   .venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
   make build-frontend
   ```
2. Enable kitty remote control (`~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`, then fully
   restart kitty):
   ```
   allow_remote_control yes
   listen_on unix:/tmp/kitty
   ```
3. Wire the hooks: point every supported Claude Code hook event directly at
   the Claude Code plugin entry:
   ```json
   "hooks": { "PostToolUse": [ { "hooks": [
       { "type": "command", "command": "/ABS/PATH/baqylau/.venv/bin/python /ABS/PATH/baqylau/client/claude_hook.py" } ] } ],
       "…every other event…": [ "… same single entry …" ] }
   ```
4. Wire the ⧉ copy links (`~/.config/kitty/open-actions.conf`):
   ```
   protocol baqylau-content
   action launch --type=background /ABS/PATH/baqylau/.venv/bin/python /ABS/PATH/baqylau/client/terminal_content.py ${URL}
   protocol baqylau-view
   action launch --type=background /ABS/PATH/baqylau/.venv/bin/python /ABS/PATH/baqylau/client/terminal_view.py ${URL}
   ```
5. Run `bin/retarget-python` once to point configured
   Claude hooks directly at the project environment and skip the pyenv shim.

## Usage

Everything activates automatically per session — the mirror opens on
`SessionStart`, the tab colors follow the hooks. Manual controls:

```sh
# Mirror pane
.venv/bin/python client/terminal_keys.py toggle|grow|shrink|reset|setpct <N>

# Smoke-test the tab colors (~3s each)
for s in idle thinking working executing awaiting-bg awaiting-command awaiting-response; do
  ./bin/claude-tab-status.py "$s"; ping -c 4 127.0.0.1 >/dev/null
done
./bin/claude-tab-status.py clear

# Raw-event audit CLI — exact source bytes and their interpretations
bin/baqylau-raw-events-audit session <sid>
bin/baqylau-raw-events-audit raw <raw_event_id>
```

## Architecture

Producer/renderer split over SQLite: ~20 short-lived hook processes plus
detached tailers append width-independent *paint ops* to a per-session state
DB; a single renderer inside the pane paints them at the live width and
reflows on resize. The code is layered so agent tools and terminals are both
pluggable:

```
core/        the floor: what knows the OS, not the domain — env, processes,
             git, where the two databases live, and the daemon client
             daemon's door, both sides)
domain/      the words, stdlib-only: the closed canonical event vocabulary,
             and the application's own value types (preferences, workspace)
repository/  the ONLY thing that opens a database. contract/ (21 Protocols,
             each method one whole transaction), model/ (a row DTO per table),
             mapper/ (row <-> model object, pure), impl/sqlite/
audit/       what the MACHINERY did — the record types, the free-function
             facade every process calls, and browser-reported telemetry
engine/      the neutral middle: engine/interpret/ (the one loop that pulls and
             translates), engine/react/ (the one that reacts and writes),
             engine/sessiondata/ (a writer per aggregate, folded once on arrival)
terminal/    the terminal concern, whole: contract + models, the panes it
             paints, and terminal/impl/<name>/ — one directory per terminal
             (kitty today), the only place a terminal's name appears
harness/     the harness concern, whole: contract + models, the hook channel,
             the services over one plugin, and harness/impl/<name>/ — one
             directory per agent tool (claude_code · codex), the only place a
             harness's name appears
dashboard/   the web surface: frontend/ (Svelte 5, strict TypeScript, Vite),
             static/ (the FastAPI-owned shell and PWA assets), services/ (one
             question, one answer), and its own config, paths, and CLI
notify/      alerts about sessions: when one is owed you (notifier), whether
             you need telling (presence), and where it reaches you (channels/)
api/         the daemon's HTTP layer — one FastAPI app, every request AND
             every response typed, every service it uses named in the handler's
             own signature
app/         the composition root: providers.py declares every node of the
             application (one provider each, wired by its signature and
             resolved by FastAPI), injection.py is the kernel that scopes them
             one-per-application, plus the services that compose concerns the
             engine keeps apart
bin/         the repository's own CLIs (audit, dashboard). Every entry an
             EXTERNAL config names lives with its concern instead —
             harness/impl/<name>/bin/ and terminal/bin/ — so a captured
             path never crosses a concern boundary
```

## Testing

```sh
make test        # frontend unit/browser gates + hermetic Python suite
make test-frontend # formatting, strict checks, and Vitest coverage
make test-browser  # isolated production daemon; Chromium and WebKit
make e2e         # live harness, live browser, and static Playwright E2E
make test-seq    # Python suite, sequential (debugging / no xdist)
make test-all    # + opt-in real-kitty smoke tests
```
