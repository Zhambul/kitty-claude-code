#
# The ephemeral, in-memory signals the deferred alert consults to decide whether
# to nag you: whether the session ended, whether you're composing an unsent
# reply, whether a browser is viewing it, and which device you most recently
# used (for on-device push routing). Live-only: no audit rows of their own — the
# SUPPRESS they drive is what lands a notify-suppress row.

# One object per application, injected by `provider_notifications.presence`.
# module dicts. The truth it holds is still process-wide — the request thread
# that records a beat and the notifier thread that reads it are the same
# application — but it is now a singleton with an owner rather than a global with
# a comment, so a second application in one interpreter (the next test) does not
# inherit the first one's beats.

# Per-DEVICE presence (`Presence.seen_at`): the last monotonic time each device

# in localStorage (app.js DEVICE_ID) POSTed on the /api/presence beat while the
# page is visible + focused (ANY view, not just a session — so it records "you
# were on this device" even from the list). The TERMINAL cannot report for itself, so it
# would have to be POLLED under the reserved id below — nothing does that today,
# and the terminal contract offers no such read until this lands. Once stamped
# it is just another device here, and that is the whole point: ONE map,
# one most-recently-seen pick, and the alert goes wherever you last were.
# This is how an alert routes to the ONE
# device you most recently used rather than fanning out to all: `route()` picks
# the device with the newest beat. Never TTL-expired for that choice (we want the
# LAST device you used even if a while ago); it's a monotonic-max pick, not a
# freshness gate — `device_active` is the separate freshness question.
#
# So this one can't be swept the way `viewing` is — no entry is ever "dead" — and
# it is CAPPED instead (BoundedLRU, recency refreshed on write = on beat). It is
# a dict of every browser that ever beat at this server, and while that is
# normally a handful, nothing bounds it: a private window mints a fresh
# DEVICE_ID per session, so a phone/laptop pair is the happy case, not the
# guarantee. Eviction is safe by construction: the LRU drops the
# least-recently-BEATEN device, which is by definition not the MRU target this
# map exists to pick — and an evicted device that beats again is simply re-added
# (a subscription that outlived its presence just reads `age_s: None`, the same
# as a device that hasn't beaten this run).
