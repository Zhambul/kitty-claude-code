"""Locate client programs and build their launch commands."""

# `client/` holds every process the daemon does not own: the two panes, the
# terminal's key and click handlers, the hooks, the OTLP receiver, the status-line
# shim. They import nothing of ours, so this is the entire daemon-side half of
# the relationship — a directory, a path and an argv. WHICH file a launcher runs
# is named by the launcher (`terminal/adapter.py` for a pane, the telemetry
# launcher under its own plugin for the receiver), because the file
# belongs to the thing that starts it — and a shared package like this one may
# not name a harness anyway. What is single-sited here is the path arithmetic,
# which is what actually broke.
#
# The root is derived from a PACKAGE, not from a file's depth: `core` sits
# directly under the repository root by definition — if it did not, no import in
# this program would resolve — so this cannot drift the way a `parents[N]` count
# can, which is exactly how every pane process once died on startup.
