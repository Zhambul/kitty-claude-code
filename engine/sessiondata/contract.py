"""What a writer is: one concern of the aggregate, folded one event at a time.

A writer does not write. It takes the aggregate as it stands and returns the
aggregate as the event leaves it, and the loop commits the difference — every
row of one event under one revision, in one transaction. That is what makes the
read model safe to poll: no reader can observe half an event.

Pure folds, so a rebuild is the same code as a live tick. The only difference
between them is which reactions run beside the writers, and that is the loop's
business, not a writer's.
