    A replay, not a rule engine: the last fact wins, and the ORDER of the
    branches below is the whole semantics. Two sets carry between events — the
    background commands still running, and the attentions still unanswered —
    because two of the branches ask a question about the past that no single
    event can answer.

    The one asymmetry worth naming: a command's finish does NOT end background
    work. A background job's launch reports finished immediately, while its
    output still flows, so ending it there emptied the set before a turn could
    ever end on it — which is how `awaiting_background` became unreachable and a
    session with a job still running read as idle. `shell.output_finished` is
    what ends background work.
