"""The verdicts a store hands out, and the operations they compose into.

The event itself, stored or not, is `domain/events.py`'s `CanonicalEvent` — one
class end to end, with `cursor`/`accepted_at`/`raw_event_ids` filled in once it
is written. What is left here is what happened AROUND an event: the verdict
reached about one raw observation, and the outcome of writing a batch of them.
